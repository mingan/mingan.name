[Bugle 4010](https://soundcloud.com/the-bugle/bugle-4010-christmas-special) is a delightful episode with Helen Zaltzman who's come down/been let out of the attic. Apart from many wonderful jokes and comments about the season, Helen describes the story of Boleslav I who had his brother Václav, henceforth known as sv. Václav (Saint Wenceslaus), murdered and named his son after this unique family event. If you find it hard to figure out the name, it's Strachkvas.
