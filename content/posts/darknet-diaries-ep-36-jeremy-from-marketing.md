Darknet Diaries is a podcast about not so good things on the internet and around computers. It has had episodes about [Israel's Unit 8200](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/28) , [the biggest publicly known hack](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/30), or a [hacker activist warning about printers exposed to the internet](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/31).

The most recent episode, _[Jeremy from Marketing](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/36)_ is an account of a pen tester's engagement. It's almost a blow-by-blow description of his approaches and the steps he takes over a week of work. From a pretty expected opening of sniffing the network, trawling through Windows network registries, employee accessible resources etc. it quickly turns to a complex puzzle of a company/fortress with an above average security in place.

I'm not really able to judge the technical depth of the episode from the point of view of a general audience but it tries very hard to relate the reality in understandable metaphors most will understand. As the story unfolds and the pen tester turns to more and more sophisticated attacks the episode just grabs you and runs away. Security as a topic has the potential to be boring as hell, the episode sounds more like a spy thriller while still grounded in reality. For me, the most relateable component was the excitement in the pen tester's voice as he comes up against yet another level of defense and has to figure out a way to solve the puzzle, to overcome it.
