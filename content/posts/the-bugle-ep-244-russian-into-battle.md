Episode 244 of The Bugle is marked by the famous [Russian pun run](https://soundcloud.com/the-bugle/bugle-244-russian-into-battle#t=18:15). It's a winding piece of the art of pun but what makes it magnificent are the disgusted reactions from John, Chris and Pat (?).

Interestingly, Andy predicted the annexation of Krymea the following year.
