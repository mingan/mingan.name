Great two part podcast series by Reply All about CompStat, a information system used by NYPD to track police work and police officers. How it came about in 1990's and it correlates with a dramatic reduction of crime. However, it's also responsible for (a portion of) nonsensical arrests and fines two decades later &mdash; police officers are trying to meet artificial quotas no matter what because the system is governed by politics which don't allow for crime rates going up. 

Not exactly a manifestation of [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).

Explains capt. Holt's mood as CompStat data deadline approaches in [s01e04 of Brooklyn Nine-Nine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3220646).
