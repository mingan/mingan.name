Listening to an episode of <cite>\[Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/archive/)</cite>, more precisely of a cross-broadcast of <cite>\[Tell Me Something I Don't Know](http://tmsidk.com/)</cite>, a titbit caught my ear: one of the contestants, Christie Aschwanden, claimed that there are specific receptors in the throat which activate differently when drinking depending on the level of thirst you feel making a glass of water delicious when you're parched.

I didn't find anything about specific receptors but there is at least \[one study documenting neural correlates](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/water-thirsty-brain_n_5028047) to the same effect.
