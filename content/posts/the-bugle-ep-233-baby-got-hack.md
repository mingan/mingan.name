Episode 233 is magical. After the opening salvos, Andy launches into a story about the [60th anniversary of Aldous Huxley and George Orwell taking mescalin for the first time](https://soundcloud.com/the-bugle/bugle-233-baby-got-hack#t=6:01). The story centers on a lawnmower impersonating a pregnant badger for a decade. John's uncomprehending reaction is priceless. 

However, that's not all! Soon after, Andy summaries a piece going to the bin: [Roosevelt's secret bucket of lobsters who via clapping in Morse code shaped American politics and lead to the New Deal as well as Stalin looking uncomfortable in the photos from the Jalta conference](https://soundcloud.com/the-bugle/bugle-233-baby-got-hack#t=8:01).

Andy humbly attributes both pieces to lack of sleep.
