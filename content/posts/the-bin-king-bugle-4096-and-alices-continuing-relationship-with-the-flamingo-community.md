Alice is my favourite new Bugle co-host by a pretty wide margin. I don't agree with her politically on almost anything and find her podcast unlistenable but her Bugle stylings are amazing.

It's rather surprising since she's encroaching on Andy's pun territory as well as coming up with ridiculous, winding similes. Somehow it works and Andy's _It's a family show, Alice!_ has become a recurring catch phrase.

In ep. 4096, Alice tackled the topic of new Unicode emojis which to her great something includes a flamingo. Dutifully, she had been alerted to this news on Twitter by dozens of buglers. One of them being me and thus giving me a first indirect mention on The Bugle.
