Episode 236 contains a lengthy hilarious piece called [Rainbow roundup](https://soundcloud.com/the-bugle/bugle-236-tennis-racquet#t=6:14) by John. The main ironically very rigid springboard is lord Norman Tebbit. Among others it includes:

- googling his photo as an experiment
- hotel Crazy town
- gay baby queen
- bungee jumping into someone's mind
- Andy's interpretation of Schrodinger's cat with full body-fur transplant
- an iguana grazing Occam's facial hair possibly known as an Occam's razor
- Andy's audio fresco illustrating the non-existent risks of people marrying their family members in order to avoid inheritance tax
- Chris's information about Tebbit having been confirmed to be genetically 100% British on a TV show
