In episode 157, Andy Zaltzman revealed that The Bugle got the rights to a serialized audio book/dramatization to _The Congressman's penis_, John Grisham's unpublished first novel. He also performed the first chapter right on the spot. It has recurred in [several episodes](http://bugle.wikia.com/wiki/The_Bugle_Index_Page).
