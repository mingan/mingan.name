Episode 278 contains:

- John firing fake fish from a cannon
- John comes out as a fan of Rihanna
- first day of BBC's broadcast with _A man's guide to screaming_ and _Guess whose cough_
- Nietzsche's meeting with God
- new merch with Andy's masterful promotion including the phrase _turn of the first millennium middle-eastern based magician and raconteur_ and John's exhaustive disclaimer

but the main event is the landing of a module on a comet with an exclusive live commentary from the operation control room, one of [Andy's best fake German bits](https://soundcloud.com/the-bugle/bugle-278-spacecats-the-search-for-merch#t=20:40), with _Schrodinger meow meow_.
