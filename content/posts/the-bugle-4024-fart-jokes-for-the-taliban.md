[Bugle 4024](https://soundcloud.com/the-bugle/bugle-4024-fart-jokes-for-the-taliban) is a great episode. It's a chance missed that Sami Shah hasn't returned since, he's very funny and works great with Andy and Alice. This brings me to Alice, who's on fire in this episode. Notable jokes include:

- comparing bleaching of The Great Coral Reef to anal bleaching
