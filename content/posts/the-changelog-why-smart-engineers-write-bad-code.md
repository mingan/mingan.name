24min - students and job applicants should learn to work with a large code base by contributing to open source projects.

I have no problem with students doing the work - it's a free work, I had a course where our final work was writing a Wikipedia article on a topic from the course.

However, if it's for job applicants, I feel like the hiring company should contribute monetarily to the open source projects to boost them.
