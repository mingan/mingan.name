[Bugle 254](https://soundcloud.com/the-bugle/bugle-254-christmas-special) is a perfect soundscape for packing Christmas presents. Among other bullshit, it contains
- NYC during winter,
- description of John's last day at The Daily Show and how emotionally unequipped he is to handle them - John crying on camera like a volcano,
- Santa-con mayhem in NYC with a combination trash can/toilet and Mrs Clause giving Santa a handjob
