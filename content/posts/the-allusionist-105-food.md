The Allusionist is a great show about language by Helen Zaltzman. In episode [_105 F'ood_](https://www.theallusionist.org/foood) she looks at names of food products, especially vegetarian or vegan alternatives. In the process, she discusses etymology of several food words including _hamburger_ and Johnny _Showbiz_ Oliver gets a drive-by mention being compared to a _hamburger_.

> But if you’re going to make it big, you’ve got to get popular in the USA, whether you’re a wodge of seasoned meat or John Oliver.
