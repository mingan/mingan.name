Personally, I don't listen to No Such Thing as a Fish podcast but I hear it often enough when my girlfriend plays it around the apartment. Most recently, I overheard [episode 243](https://audioboom.com/posts/7089339-episode-243-no-such-thing-as-jean-paul-sartre-s-crabs). At around 36:40 mark a fact about Jean-Paul Sartre comes up. Apparently, after having taken mescaline he hallucinated a cast of crabs following him around. It lasted for years and he had a relationship with them, asking them to be quit during lectures.

I believe this is the first time I encountered (indirectly) a Wikipedia page which spawned one of [Andy's lies on Bugle](https://www.mingan.name/posts/the-bugle-ep-233-baby-got-hack/), namely Roosevelt's bucket of lobsters asking for a new deal.
